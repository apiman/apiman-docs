= Apiman docs website & Antora playbook

This is where we generate our https://www.apiman.io/apiman-docs/[documentation^] using the https://antora.org/[wonderful Antora documentation website generator^].

The actual documentation is stored in other repositories. 
This is where we maintain our link:antora-playbook.yml[Antora Playbook] which pulls in the documentation sources from our various docs repos and generates the HTML for GitHub Pages. 

To build the docs, you can run:

```bash
npm ci
# If you had a docs directory generated previously you want to clobber
rm -fr docs
# Use the locally installed version of Antora
npx antora generate --fetch --stacktrace antora-playbook.yml 
```

Now you should see the website pop out in the `docs` directory, and you can open it in your browser of choice.
